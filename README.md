# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

User is able to go through a list of customer and see who is and isn't likely to Churn (leave the bank). The model generates a prediction and provides the user with the percentage likelihood of churning and information on what reasons the model has for the given prediction. If the user is likely to churn a personal email is AI generated by Groq to send to the customer with incentives to encourage them to stay.

## Project Details
Built end-to-end pipeline for a customer churn prediction model. During this process I trained 5 different machine learning models, performed hyperparameter tuning, and served the model for inference through a web app made through Replit.

## QA Workshop Notes
- creating a machine learning model that calculates the possibility of a user leaving the bank
- Churn is a term used for leaving a company or subscription
- teaching a ML model patterns on set data that it can then use on unseen data to provide quick analysis and scalable predictions

GOAL:<br>
Analyze 10 features provided for each data point and predict the possibility of that customer churning

"If you train on bad data you produce bad results"

##### Making the model an API
**render.com**
--> deployment of models 
--> gives you a domain
--> fastAPI server
--> send request and receive a prediction based on data
>Create web services > select GitHub you want to work on > branch main > region> start command "python main.py" > free tier

files within Churn ML model
> main
>xgb_model.pkl
>requirements.txt

**if you installed dependencies directly in the terminal (e.g. pip install numpy) you can do a "pip freeze > requirements.txt" to automatically add them to the file

** importance of formatting data to go into the dataframe
** in future would actually need to add error handling

python needs specific versions in the requirements.txt file

Resume Description Example:
"Deployed XGBoost model to production to ** users with latency of ## milliseconds"
