# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

User is able to go through a list of customer and see who is and isn't likely to Churn (leave the bank). The model generates a prediction and provides the user with the percentage likelihood of churning and information on what reasons the model has for the given prediction. If the user is likely to churn a personal email is AI generated by Groq to send to the customer with incentives to encourage them to stay.

## Project Details
Built end-to-end pipeline for a customer churn prediction model. During this process I trained 5 different machine learning models, performed hyperparameter tuning, and served the model for inference through a web app made through Replit.
